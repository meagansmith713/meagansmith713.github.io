I'm first and foremost your quintessential "creative type" in every facet of my life. I love to diversify the kinds of projects I'm working on, which currently means taking on a wide variety of freelance editing projects both fictional and nonfictional and sending exciting styles to my clients at Stitch Fix. (Did I mention that I teach dance and aerial arts, too?)

I have a passion for learning and for teaching, I love working in a setting that involves communication with others, and I dive in headfirst whenever a new opportunity presents itself. Reach out to me about projects or jobs related to writing, editing, teaching, or putting together fresh ideas!
